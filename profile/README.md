# Lab25 | Cognitive and Behavioral Science

**An innovative research center at the Faculty of Psychology, National Autonomous University of MÃ©xico (UNAM), Mexico City.**

We investigate the principles by which organisms acquire knowledge about their environmentâ€™s structure and how this knowledge guides their actions within it. Our mission is to advance the understanding of how both biological and artificial agents adapt their behavior in response to environmental challenges and opportunities, solving the problem of adaptation to the statistical properties of their surroundings.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

Our interdisciplinary team combines **experimental psychology**, **computational modeling**, and **behavioral analysis** to bridge the gap between behavioral observations and underlying cognitive mechanisms. We study the solutions and mechanisms of behavior across species, with a core focus on:

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** How organisms learn from experience and feedback.
*   **Decision-Making:** Processes under conditions of **temporal constraints (Intertemporal Choice)** and **uncertainty (Risky Choice)**.
*   **Perceptual Decision Making:** How sensory information guides choices.
*   **Temporal Processing:** The perception of time and its role in behavior.
*   **Game Theory:** Strategic decision-making in social contexts.
*   **Categorization:** How organisms organize and classify information.
*   **Bayesian Modeling:** Developing computational models of learning and decision-making.

## ðŸ§  Our Approach

We employ cutting-edge methodologies and theoretical frameworks to understand the computational principles of adaptation. Our work promotes an **open science** approach, committed to sharing methodologies, data, and findings with the broader scientific community. We actively collaborate with researchers worldwide and are dedicated to training the next generation of cognitive scientists.
